Now, you will be asked to find the exit in the maze by repeating the route you just learned in the training phase from memory.
If you make a wrong turn, red arrows will appear on the floor that will guide you back on track.
Please let the experimenter know if you have any questions.
To begin, press the blue "Continue" button with the trackpad, and walk towards a set of footprints on the floor.
